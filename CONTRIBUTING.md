1. Features over bugs

  implemented. We prioritize empowering Enterprise™ developers to disrupt, even
  if there are some rough edges. Rememeber

2. Disrupt. Disrupt. Disrupt.

  Incremental improvements? Forget it. Send bold ideas. Think outside the box.
  Be different. Just do it.

3. Focus on user base

  Porting Enterprise™ to Haskell? Don't sweat. JVM? Cloud? Crypto dockerized
  block chains? Bring it.

4. Commit messages

  Don't sweat, no one reads 'em. Add some ™s for the stylish effect.
