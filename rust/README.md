# Enterprise™ rust edition X™

<img src="../assets/logo.png" align="right" />

Enterprise™ rust edition X™ is a parser and [soon to be] compiler for the
[Enterprise™](https://github.com/joaomilho/Enterprise) language written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Enterprise™ rust edition X™ is reliable and efficient - since it's Rust – but it's
also disruptive – since it's Enterprise™. What a combo!

## Roadmap

☑ Parser with pest
☐ Compiler with cranelift
