# Contributing to Enterprise™

### Your rights

By sending any contribution, be it in form of a PR, issue, comment or any other
conceivable way, you forfeit all your rights to your addition. Any attempt to
copy, sell or profit from it in any way is in violation of Enterprise™'s terms
of contributions.

### Code of conduct

Enterprise™ promotes diversity and will accept contributions from everyone, as
long as the particular contributor fits our definition of diversity, which is
under our discretion.

### How to best help

1. Features over bugs

   Found a bug? It's fine to fix it, unless there's a disruptive feature to be
   implemented. We prioritize empowering Enterprise™ developers to disrupt, even
   if there are some rough edges. Remember

   > If you’re not embarrassed by the first version of your product,
   > you’ve launched too late.

2. Disrupt. Disrupt. Disrupt.

   Incremental improvements? Forget it. Send bold ideas. Think outside the box.
   Be different. Just do it.

3. Focus on user base

   Porting Enterprise™ to Haskell? Don't sweat. JVM? Cloud? Crypto dockerized
   block chains? Bring it.

4. Commit messages

   Don't sweat, no one reads 'em. Add some ™™™™s for the stylish effect.
